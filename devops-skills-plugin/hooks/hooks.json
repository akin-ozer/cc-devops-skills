Do NOT skip to implementation.\n\nExample:\n- dockerfile-generator: YES - creating a new Dockerfile\n- dockerfile-validator: YES - need to validate generated Dockerfile\n- k8s-yaml-validator: NO - not working with Kubernetes manifests\n\nThen IMMEDIATELY use Skill() tool:\n> Skill(dockerfile-generator)\n> Skill(dockerfile-validator)\n\nTHEN and ONLY THEN start implementation"
